blobseer-deploy is a Python script used to deploy, check status and kill
BlobSeer. Interpreting output is very simple: no output means everything
went fine.

Parameters are: 
--vmgr=hostname -> the name of the host associated to the version manager
--pmgr=hostname -> the name of the host associated to the provider manager
--dht=filename ->  a file containing the name of the hosts associated to metadata providers
--providers=filename -> a file containing the name of the hosts associated to providers

--kill -> kill all processes
--status -> check if the needed processes are running
--launch=templatename  -> deploy all processes and use templatename as configuration file

Two simple scripts: local-deploy.sh and local-kill.sh can be used to deploy
BlobSeer on the local machine.

All output is redirected in /tmp/blobseer/* and the generated configuration file
is /tmp/blobseer.cfg
