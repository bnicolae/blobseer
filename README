BlobSeer
========

BlobSeer is a large-scale, distributed data storage system that
addresses storage requirements in an innovating way, aiming to deal
with the explosion of data sizes in a scalable fashion.  It emerged
from the idea of leveraging versioning for concurrent manipulation of
binary large objects (BLOBs) in order to efficiently exploit
data-level parallelism and sustain a high throughput despite massively
parallel data accesses. Features of BlobSeer include:

- a versioning based access model distributed data and metadata
- instant snapshots and clones.  specific optimizations for virtual
- machine image storage, such as a hybrid pre/post copy live I/O block
- migration scheme

BlobSeer is the main research project of Bogdan Nicolae and formed the
core of his PhD thesis "BlobSeer: Towards efficient data storage
management for large-scale, distributed systems", defended Nov 30,
2010 at the University of Rennes 1, France.  It is currently used in
numerous research projects of the KerData team, INRIA Rennes, France.
